Some thoughts about stuff which should be done.

o Forward patches upstream (lots of changes is needed,
  and the code needs quite a bit of love)

o The above also includes stuff like using fixed paths for
  mount/umount/fsck/etc, see comments in debian/rules
  around configure call -- these should be fixed upstream
  properly.

o Deal with de-applying patches to configure (see #674391).
  Upstream keeps configure and include/config.h.in files in
  git and stores any changes in these in git too, so upstrem
  patches contains hunks destined for these files.  So initially
  we have original configure from orig.tar, next we patch it
  using upstream patches, next we regenerate it from configure.in.
  At this point (and note that distclean target explicitly
  regenerates configure), patches applied to original configure
  can't be deapplied anymore.

o Verify if we should have sss autofs package.  The configure
  test for this -- AF_CHECK_SSS_LIB in aclocal.m4 -- is wrong,
  since it only looks in /usr/lib and /usr/lib64.

o Verify if we should include libtirpc support.
