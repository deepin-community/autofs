autofs (5.0.8-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Salvatore Bonaccorso <carnil@debian.org> ]
  * Add patches for CVE-2014-8169 (Closes: #779591).
    When a program map uses an interpreted languages like python it is
    possible to load and execute arbitray code from a user home directory.
    This is because the standard environment variables are used to locate
    and load modules when using these languages. To avoid that, a prefix to
    these environment names is added so that they aren't used for this
    purpose. The prefix used is "AUTOFS_" and is not configurable.
    Additionally a configuration option to force the use of program map
    standard environment variables is added (FORCE_STANDARD_PROGRAM_MAP_ENV).

    - fixed remount deadlock, and several other locking fixes
    - fixed umount recovery for busy direct mounts
    - removed old code (mount-move which was fixed in 5.0.6-4 #686438)
    - fix hosts lookup module to be more robust
    - implemented abilty to re-read indirect maps on the fly (sighup)
    - fixes for nfs handling to be more robust

    - several fixes for NFSv4 mounts (Closes: #675798)

  * refreshed manpages-hyphen.patch.

    - 0005-autofs-5.0.7-fix-typo-in-automount-8.patch
  * added remove-kernel-mount.nfs-version-check.patch to stop automount from
    checking for very old mount.nfs or kernel.  The check isn't necessary
    (that's pre-squeeze versions, so not even versioned Breaks are needed
    anymore), but it is also harmful, since automount spawns mount.nfs at
    startup and confuses upstart and systemd who start tracking wrong
    process.  The patch just removes these checks assuming we always use
    recent enough versions.  (Closes: #678555)

    - do no ship /etc/default/autofs (Closes: #673796)
    - install /etc/init.d/autofs manually (dh_installinit have issue finding it)
    - removed ugly symlinks debian/autofs.{default,init}
    - list bin programs and modules more explicitly in debian/*.install
    - transfer ucf conffile ownership from old autofs5 to autofs
  * removed debian/configure_override
  * recommend kmod|module-init-tools
  * ship debian/autofs.init instead of heavily patching upstream script
  * simplify (and fix) debian/autofs.init a bit in loading/checking modules,
    and use /bin/sh instead of /bin/bash
  * remove messing with /dev/autofs misc device in initscript,
    it is managed by udev or devtmpfs
  * remove (now unused) USE_MISC_DEVICE definition from default/autofs too
  * do not check for modprobe or procfs in configure, since module loading
    is ifdef'ed out in the code, and #ifdef the missing parts too
    (do-not-check-for-modprobe-procfs-or-load-module.patch)
  * always define standard program paths when building even if the corresponding
    utility isn't installed (e2fsck, mount, mount.nfs).  There is no need to
    check presence of standard utilities or verify their standard abilities.
  * also define other paths explicitly instead of relying on a config-time
    search - the build will be wrong if some directory (eg, /etc/sysconfig)
    will be present during configure time.
  * autoreconf and clean autoconf-generated files, FTBFS (Closes: #674391)
    This still does not make quilt patches easily revertable, since we
    don't save old configure and upstream changes patches configure to,
    so once regenerated by autoreconf, it will be different.
  * do not use $DEB_HOST_MULTIARCH in debian/rules without setting it
  * two patches:
      debian/patches/link-daemon-with-lpthread.patch
      debian/patches/save-hesiod-libs-correctly.patch
    to fix gold/-Wl,-no-as-needed FTBFS.

    with single autofs-5.0.6-upstream-git.patch - all upstream commits in
    master branch since release_5_0_6 tag.  Update this patch to include
